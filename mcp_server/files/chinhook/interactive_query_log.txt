LLM Response:
❌ SQL Execution Error: Execution failed on sql 'with ArtistId in the range 1-275 (since they're mentioned in the top values of the Album.ArtistId column). We also know that the album "Koyaanisqatsi (Soundtrack from the Motion Picture)" has a AlbumId between 0 and 347, which doesn't include any Metallica albums.

To find the TrackId corresponding to each song by Metallica, we would need to join the `Album` table with the `Track` table on the AlbumId. Then, we can filter the results for only those tracks whose album has an ArtistId corresponding to Metallica (ArtistId between 1-275).

Here is the SQL query that answers the user's question:

LLM Response:
Based on the provided database schema, I can help you with that!

Since there's no specific table for artists and their corresponding tracks, we'll need to join relevant tables together to get the desired information.

Let's start by joining the `Track` table with the `Album` table using the `AlbumId` column:

```sql
SELECT t.Name
FROM Track t
JOIN Album a ON t.AlbumId = a.AlbumId
WHERE a.ArtistName = 'AC/DC';
```

However, since we don't have an `ArtistName` column in either the `Track` or `Album` table, we'll need to use the `ArtistId` column to link tracks to their respective artists.

Let's join the `Track` table with the `Artist` table using the `ArtistId` column:

```sql
SELECT t.Name
FROM Track t
JOIN Artist a ON t.Album.ArtistId = a.ArtistId
WHERE a.Name = 'AC/DC';
```

This query will return all tracks by AC/DC. If you want to filter the results by specific albums, you can modify the query as needed!

Please let me know if this helps or if you have further questions!

LLM Response:
The issue is that the `Album` table does not have an `ArtistName` column. Instead, it has an `ArtistId` column which links to the `Artist` table.

To get the list of songs by AC/DC, we can join the `Track` table with the `Album` table and then join the result with the `Artist` table using the `ArtistId` column. Here's the corrected SQL:

```sql
SELECT t.Name

User Prompt: List all the songs by the artist AC/DC released after 1984.
LLM Response:
To list all the songs by the artist AC/DC released after 1984, we can modify the previous SQL query to filter the results based on the release year.

Since there's no specific column for the release year in either the `Track` or `Album` table, we'll need to join these tables with the `PlaylistTrack` table, which has a `Milliseconds` column that represents the duration of the track (approximate release date).

Here's the modified SQL query:

```sql
SELECT t.Name
FROM Track t
JOIN Album a ON t.AlbumId = a.AlbumId
JOIN Artist ar ON a.ArtistId = ar.ArtistId
JOIN PlaylistTrack pt ON t.TrackId = pt.TrackId
WHERE ar.Name = 'AC/DC'
AND pt.Milliseconds > 3153600000; -- equivalent to release date after 1984 (12/31/1984)
```

This query will return all tracks by AC/DC released after 1984. Note that this calculation is an approximation, as the `Milliseconds` column represents the duration of the track in milliseconds, not the actual release date.
Final SQL:
SELECT t.Name
FROM Track t
JOIN Album a ON t.AlbumId = a.AlbumId
JOIN Artist ar ON a.ArtistId = ar.ArtistId
