User Prompt: It return empty table
LLM Response:
Let's troubleshoot this together. The query seems correct, but let's check a few things:

1. Are there any students enrolled in the 'MATH101' class?
2. Is the `class` table properly linked to the `enrollment` and `student` tables?

To investigate further, I'll modify the query to include more information about the joins and the data being retrieved.

Here's an updated query:

```sql
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, s.email
FROM enrollment e
JOIN student s ON e.student_id = s.student_id
WHERE e.class_id IN (
  SELECT c.class_id
  FROM class c
  WHERE c.name = 'MATH101'
)
AND EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM enrollment ee
  WHERE ee.student_id = s.student_id
  AND ee.class_id = e.class_id
);
```

This query uses an `EXISTS` clause to ensure that the student is actually enrolled in at least one class. If no students are found, the result set will be empty.

Please try this updated query and let me know if it returns any results.

User Prompt: Still empty the enrolled data is in enrolled table
LLM Response:
Let's try to identify the issue. Since you've confirmed that the enrolled data exists in the `enrollment` table, let's focus on the join and the filtering criteria.

Here's a modified query with additional logging:
```sql
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, s.email
FROM enrollment e
JOIN student s ON e.student_id = s.student_id
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM enrollment ee
    WHERE ee.student_id = s.student_id
    AND ee.class_id = e.class_id
  )
WHERE e.class_id IN (
  SELECT c.class_id
  FROM class c
  WHERE c.name = 'MATH101'
);
```
This query includes the `AND EXISTS` clause inside the join condition to ensure that we only consider students who are actually enrolled in at least one class. If this query still returns an empty result set, it might be because there are no students enrolled in the 'MATH101' class.

To troubleshoot further, can you please provide me with the exact count of rows in each table?

1. `enrollment` (total count)
2. `student` (total count)
3. `class` (total count)
4. `class` where `name = 'MATH101'` (specifically)

This information will help me better understand the data and identify potential issues.

LLM Response:
I apologize for the mistake. The error is due to the fact that there is no direct link between the `marks` and `class` tables. We need to join the `enrollment` table as well to establish a connection between the marks and class.

Here's the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT AVG(m.score) AS avg_marks
FROM marks m
JOIN enrollment e ON m.enrollment_id = e.enrollment_id
JOIN class c ON e.class_id = c.class_id
WHERE c.name = 'Psychology I';
```

This query first joins `marks` with `enrollment`, then joins `enrollment` with `class`. The resulting set of marks for Psychology I is then averaged to find the average score.
Final SQL:
SELECT AVG(m.score) AS avg_marks
FROM marks m
JOIN enrollment e ON m.enrollment_id = e.enrollment_id
